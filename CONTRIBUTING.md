## Bug reports
A bug is a *demonstrable problem* that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search**. Check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed**. Try to reproduce it using the latest master or development branch in the repository.

3. **Provide environment details**. Provide your Android OS version, devices, and any other system information you think would be important.

4. **Create an isolated and reproducible test case**. Create a reduced test case with clear documentation.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.

* What is your environment?
* What steps will reproduce the issue?
* What version(s) of Android OS experience the problem?
* What would you expect to be the outcome?
**All these details** will help people to fix any potential bugs.

###Example:

>Short and descriptive example bug report title
>A summary of the issue and the OS environment in which it occurs. If suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.

>This is the first step
This is the second step
Further steps, etc.
<url> - a link to the reduced test case

Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their merits).

## Pull requests
* Please provide any visuals you may have with your pull request.
* Adhere to Android style guides.
* Thoroughly document new code.

## More information
You can find out more detailed information in the [documentation][readme].
